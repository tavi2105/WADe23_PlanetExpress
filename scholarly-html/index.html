    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This is a technical report which presents information about the APIs that are going to serve the MIR
      application, about the structures of data that we use and about the overall implementation of the project.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Migration Reporting Tool is a <b>Web system</b> that is capable to generate in real-time an interactive map
      regarding the migrations performed by humans (with the possibility of extending with data about other species) in
      a specific context. The application will also deliver
      useful statistics and visualizations about the migratory habits of specific species and all this information
      will
      be offered by a <b>SPARQL endpoint</b> (also enhanced by additional knowledge provided by DBpedia / Wikidata).
    </p>
    <p>
      This technical report was created with the purpose of explaining how the application can be used by the users, a
      general description of its structure and components, how the APIs are created and what kind of data we use and
      where is it from. The information about all these will be gradually added as we progress with the development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Details about development:
    <ul>
      <li>For frontend we will use React - a javascript library</li>
      <li>The backend will be developed using Python with Flask framework</li>
      <li>For the database our choice is Apache Jena Fuseki TripleStore</li>
      <li>Data about migration events is processed and modeled using RDF (rdflib library from python) and accessed using
        SPARQL endpoint provided by Apache Jena.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Structure and Details about the Web system</h2>
    <section id="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The applincation lets the user explore migration map, visuals and statistics for humans (for now). It is also
        extensible for data about other species. The choice of species cand be made by the user among available species
        at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the user makes a choice, he will be able to visualize data about migrations in two sections: live and
        history. For the both sections there are some filters that can be applied. For the history tab there are also
        statistics and charts are
        available for the data requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        The users can also register some data regarding migration events that they know or maybe they were involved
        in.

      <h3>Components</h3>
      <section id="c-01">
        <h3>MIR Web Site</h3>
        <h4>UI Interface</h4>
        <p>Our Front End is developed using <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/">React</a>, a JavaScript
          library for building interfaces, powered by Meta Platforms, Inc. The main libraries that we used are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://mui.com/">(MUI) - Material UI</a> for most of the components
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.react-simple-maps.io/">React Simple Maps</a> for rendering the maps
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://axios-http.com/docs/intro">Axios</a> for API calls
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          On the first page that users see, there will be the following components:
        <ul>
          <li>The title of the application</li>
          <li>A dropdown that they can use to select the species for which they want to see migration events</li>
          <li>A button that will navigate to the page with the map</li>
          <li>A button that will redirect the users to a page where they can add their own data.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img/welcome_page.png" alt="Welcome page image" class="presentation-image">
        </p>
        <p>
          Another page is the one where user can explore migration map. It has two tabs:
        <ul>
          <li>
            History
            <ul>
              <li>Displays an interactive map where migration events can be visualised</li>
              <li>Next to the map, there are some filters regarding the country to be focused, age/sex of
                migrants, year of migration</li>
              <li>Under the map, there is a table which displays all migration events according to the filters</li>
              <li>There are also charts with statistics regarding origin/destination country and number of migrants.
              </li>
            </ul>

          The page where user can add data is composed of:
        <ul>
          <li>A form with details that he has to fill - the user is asked for location permision and if it's allowed,
            the destination country is automatically set on current contry and can be changed after</li>

        <h3>MIR Rest API</h3>
        <p>
          In this project our API implemented in Flask (Python based) it is a layer between our FrontEnd and the Apache
          Jena
          Fuseki TripleStore. The API provided by the server is used in general for performing GET operations in order
          to retrieve
          the data for generating the map and statistics. However, since the user can also add some data about
          migrations there
          are also POST operations available. Complete details about these can be found in <a
            href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/tavi2105/MIR_PlanetExpress/1.0.0">our OpenAPI specification.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the API performs three main operations:
        <ul>
          <li>for GET migrations history and filters calls, the API makes a SELECT query over the SPARQL Endpoint to get
            the filtered
            data</li>
          <li>for POST migration, the API makes a INSERT query over the SPQRQL Endpoint in order to add new migration
            event to the
            TripleStore</li>
          <li>for GET live migration, the API calls our intern migration generator (which generates random migrations).
            The
            endpoint is SSE based (Server-sent events) continually providing migration events every 7 seconds. The
            generator is
            updating the migrations each iteration. After a migration ends (gots 100% progress), it will be inserted
            also in the
            TripleStore through the SPQRQL Endpoint.</li>

        <h3>MIR Datasets and models</h3>
        <p>
          We store the dataset provided by OECD API. This dataset is based on filters (like years, countries, etc), so
          our
          database is stuctured in the same way. We processed it and changed it to fill up our requirements. After that
          we modeled
          it using RDF (rdflib library from python) in order to create our ontology. We stored this as a RDF/Turtle
          file, which
          was loaded into Apache Jena Fuseki TripleStore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The description of our models:
        </p>
        <img src="img/Model_countries.png" alt="Description of model for country" class="presentation-image">
        <img src="img/Model_migration.png" alt="Description of model for migration" class="presentation-image">
        <p>
          Each country has its own node containing the name of the coutnry and the coordinates. The migration model is
          linked with
          each destination and origin countries models. As vocabularies we used <a
            href=" https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> and <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a>. We also used
          <a href="https://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>
          resources as URIs for each country.
        </p>
        <p>Our dataset contains 536568 migration events. We created this graph using just 10000 migration events:</p>
        <img src="img/Big_graph_10000.png" alt="Graph with 10000 migration events" class="presentation-image">
        <p>Let's simply it by using just 10 migration events. We can see a lot of contries with no conections.</p>
        <img src="img/Graph_10_migration.png" alt="Graph with 10 migration events" class="presentation-image">
        <p>Now, let's take a look at one migration event. The migration model is linked with the each contry's model.

        <p><b>SELECT migrations:</b></p>
        <img src="img/SELECT_query.png" alt="Select migrations query" class="presentation-image">
        <p>As you can see, in our API, this query contains some parameters, such as age, gender and country, these
          parameters are
          default setted to "All ages", "Men and women" and "All years". The year filter is added just if the call from
          the
          FrontEnd contains this filter. This query is this big because we wanted to return all details about each data.
          We tried
          different versions and we picked the fastest one.</p>
        <p><b>INSERT migration:</b></p>
        <img src="img/INSERT_query.png" alt="Insert migration query" class="presentation-image">
        <p>This query contains an "INSERT" for every triple that needs to be added for one migration.</p>
        <p>We also have a SPARQL call for <b>selecting filter values:</b></p>

      <h3>External API</h3>
      <p>
        "The OECD provides access to datasets in the catalogue of OECD databases through a RESTful application
        programming
        interface (API) based on the SDMX-JSON standard. This allows a developer to easily call the API using simple
        RESTful URL
        programmatically." - <a href="https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-json-documentation/">API Documentation</a>. So,
        we'll use this API in order
        to update our dataset with fresh
        migration data.
        We can call this API or just download CSVs form its webpage, to store datasets filtred by age, country, year,
        occupation, education, etc. This resource contains datasets only for the human migration part.

  <section id="user-guide">
    <h2>User Guide</h2>
    <p>In these section we will present the three main flows that a user can complete in our web application.</p>
    <section id="migration-history-map">
      <h2>Migration History Map</h2>
      <p>You can acces this page by clicking the "VIEW MIGRATION MAP" button from the main page.
        This is the page where you can explore details about migration events among years and between different
        countries. The migrations that are displayed are automatically filtered by a country (marked with a pin on
        map), and there are also
        addition filters that can be applied: number of migrants, year of migration, age of migrants, sex of
        migrants.</p>
      <p>The default country filter is Romania.The legend explains what the colors that you can see on the map
        mean.</p>
      <p>To apply filters, you have to select your options from the dropdowns and click the "APPLY FILTERS" button.
        Example of filtering:</p>
      <img src="img/history_map_guide_1.png" alt="History tab - map with different filters applied"
        class="presentation-image">
      <p>Under the map you can see a table which contains all migration events that atch yor filtering.</p>
      <img src="img/history_map_guide_2.png" alt="History tab - table without the second country filter applied"
        class="presentation-image">
      <p>The map is interactive, meaning that you can click on a country to see it's name and also to add one more
        filter yo the table.</p>
      <p>When you select a country, it's name will be displayed and it will be colored with dark blue on the map.</p>
      <p>Example on the previous filter selection and United States of America highlighted on the map:</p>
      <img src="img/history_map_guide_3.png"
        alt="History tab - map with highlighted country and different filters applied" class="presentation-image">
      <img src="img/history_map_guide_4.png" alt="History tab - table with the second country filter applied"
        class="presentation-image">
      <p>You can also analyse two different types of charts: a bar chart and one or two piecharts.</p>
      <p>The barchart is plotted on a top 10 by total number of individuals that migrated between two countries on
        filtered data. It shows for each of these countries the number if immigrants and the number of emigrants
        reported to the selected country.</p>
      <img src="img/history_map_guide_5.png" alt="Barchart" class="presentation-image">
      <p>There are two available piecharts: one that shows you the proportions between the number of immigrants from
        each country and one that shows you proportions between the number of emigrants to each country. This is why
        in some cases there
        might not be two of them: if, for example, there are no countries for which we have emigrants, there will be
        no chart about this.</p>
      <p>The colors of the pie charts are randomly generated.</p>
      <img src="img/history_map_guide_6.png" alt="Piecharts" class="presentation-image">
    </section>
    <section id="migration-live-map">
      <h2>Migration live map</h2>
      <p>Here you can see an interactive map showing the migration events that are happening at the time you are
        watching the map. Each marker position is updated in real time. You can hover any marker on the map and see
        details about that specific event. The markers disappear once the migration is completed.</p>
      <p>Next to the map you can see a list of cards that display details about each pending migration event, together
        with the progress percentage that is also updated in real time.</p>
      <img src="img/live_map_guide_1.png" alt="Live map - hovered marker" class="presentation-image">
      <p>You can hover one of the cards from the list and it will become highlighted. This will also highlight the
        corresponding countries on the map with the same color.</p>
      <img src="img/live_map_guide_2.png" alt="Live map - hovered card" class="presentation-image">
      <p>Above the map you will se a dropdown with country names. This allows you to filter the live events that you see
        on the map on a country. Nothe that is's possible that at the time you are watching, for a specific country
        there are no migration events.</p>
      <p>There is a color code here. If the marker is green, it means that individuals are migrating TO the selected
        country. If the marker is red, it means that the individuals are migrating FROM the selected country.</p>
      <img src="img/live_map_guide_3.png" alt="Live map - filtered by country" class="presentation-image">
    </section>
    <section id="add-event-page">
      <h2>Add migration event</h2>
      <p>On this page you are able to add a new migration event. Assuming that you will probably want to enter a
        migration event you were part of, the application will request permision to your location and automatically fill
        the destination field with the name of the country you are in. This can be changed if it's not the case.</p>
      <img src="img/add_event_guide_1.png" alt="Add event - request location permision" class="presentation-image">
      <p>You will not be allowed to add an event without introducing all mandatory fields that are marqued with *. If
        you try, a warning message will be displayed.</p>
      <img src="img/add_event_guide_2.png" alt="Add event - warning message, form not filled"
        class="presentation-image">
      <p>If everything is filled and you click "ADD EVENT" a request will be made. If it's successful you will see a
        success message and this means the action was performed.</p>
      <img src="img/add_event_guide_3.png" alt="Add event - success message, for filled" class="presentation-image">
      <p>If any error happens, you will see an error message.</p>
      <img src="img/add_event_guide_4.png" alt="Add event - error message, for filled" class="presentation-image">
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="future-work">
    <h2>Future work</h2>
    <p>As future work, this application can be extendend for exploring migration events for different catregories of
      individuals. For now we only use data for human beings, but it will be very useful to give the user multiple
      possibilities. Considering the fact that our initial goal was to also use data for birds, this can be added as
      well as other species.</p>
