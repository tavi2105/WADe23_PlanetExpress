      - check refs
      - the math example has too much maths
      - bring back some of the old style
      - make semantics, validation, processing sub-sections of each structural element
      - have a section before that for general constructs
        - explain why use RDFa
        - explain our patterns: RDFa, roles
      - figure captions need to get set throughout
      - dedication? see doc-dedication
      - syntactic constraints (prefix)
      - needs more sthenurines
      - examples of everything
      - some notes on using Semantic CSS

      This is a technical report which presents information about the APIs that are going to serve the MIR
      application
      and about the structures of data that we use.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Migration Reporting Tool is a <b>Web system</b> that is capable to generate in real-time an interactive map
      regarding the migrations performed by humans or birds in a specific context. The application will also deliver
      useful statistics and visualizations about the migratory habits of specific species and all this information
      will
      be offered by a <b>SPARQL endpoint</b> (also enhanced by additional knowledge provided by DBpedia / Wikidata).
    </p>
    <p>
      This technical report was created with the purpose of explaining how the application can be used by the users, a
      general description of its structure and components, how the APIs are created and what kind of data we use and
      where is it from. The information about all these will be gradually added as we progress with the development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Details about development:
    <ul>
      <li>For frontend we will use React - a javascript library</li>
      <li>The backend will be developed using Python with Django framework</li>
      <li>For the database our choice is MongoDB</li>
      <li>Data about migration events will be modeled and accessed using RDF, RDF Schema, SPARQL.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="structure">
    <h2>Structure and Details about the Web system</h2>
    <section id="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The applincation will let user select what he wants to search: migration map, visuals and statistics for
        humans or for birds?
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the user makes a choice, he will be able to visualize data about migrations in two sections: live and
        history. For the both sections there are some filters that can be applied and also statistics and charts are
        available for the data requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        The users can also register some data regarding migration events that they know or maybe they were involved
        in.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="components">
      <h3>Components</h3>
      <section id="c-01">
        <h3>MIR Web Site</h3>
        <h4>UI Interface</h4>
        <p><b>Note:</b>The followin detials are not necessarily final decisions and might end up different in the final
          implementation.</p>
        <p>
          On the first page that users see, there will be the following components:
        <ul>
          <li>A welcome message</li>
          <li>A dropdown that they can use to select the species for which they want to see migration events</li>
          <li>A button that will navigate to the page with the map</li>
          <li>A button that will redirect the users to a page where they can add their own data.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another page will be the one with the map, with the following features:
        <ul>
          <li>There will be two tabs - Live and History</li>
          <li>On each there will be a map showing details about migration</li>
          <li>Next to the map there will be filters regarding age o migrants, year of migration, detination, occupation
            etc</li>
          <li>There will also be charts and statisticts regarding the data, and those will be updated based on
            filtering.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The page where user can add data will be composed of:
        <ul>
          <li>A form with details that he has to fill</li>
          <li>A submit button</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>MIR Rest API</h3>
        <p>
          The API provided by the server is used in general for performing GET operations in order to retrieve the
          data for generating the map and statistics. However, since the user can also add some data about migrations
          there are also POST operations available. Complete details about these can be found in our OpenAPI
          specification.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="c-02">
        <h3>MIR Database</h3>
        <p>
          We store the dataset provided by OECD API in our database. This dataset is based on filters (like years,
          countries,
          etc), so our database is stuctured in the same way. In addition, in this database we'll have a another dataset
          stored,
          this time for birds migration.
        </p>

    <section id="external-api">
      <h3>External API</h3>
      <p>
        "The OECD provides access to datasets in the catalogue of OECD databases through a RESTful application
        programming
        interface (API) based on the SDMX-JSON standard. This allows a developer to easily call the API using simple
        RESTful URL
        programmatically." - <a href="https://data.oecd.org/api/sdmx-json-documentation/">API Documentation</a>. So,
        we'll use this API in order
        to update our dataset with fresh
        migration data.
        We can call this API or just download CSVs form its webpage, to store datasets filtred by age, country, year,
        occupation, education, etc. This resource contains datasets only for the human migration part.
